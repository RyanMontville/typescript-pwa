                <h3>Q: "I used a different account in previous years, can you link my accounts so it shows I
                    participated every year?"</h3>
                <p>A: User rankings and stats are generated based on username and the database has no way of knowing
                    that 2 different accounts are the same person. If you want, you can choose which username you want to keep,
                    then we will merge the stats and delete the other account from the database. Message
                    <a href="https://sh.itjust.works/u/the_real_monte">&#64;the_real_monte</a> with both usernames and
                    which one you want to keep. We will send both a message to both accounts to verifiy you own both. If
                    the instance has shut down, verification will not be necessary as long as the usernames match.

                <h3>Q: "How does this site work? Where does the data for the stats come from?"</h3>
                <p>A: The databse log gets posted on Lemmy after the event has ended. We use sqlite and python to
                    generate the statistics. The stats are stored in csv files on Github. The website runs on vanilla Typescript with D3.js 
                    for the charts and graphs, HTML Canvas for images of the canvas, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
