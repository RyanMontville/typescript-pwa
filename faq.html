                <h3>Q: "I used a different account in 2023/2024, can you link my accounts so it shows I participated
                    every
                    year?"</h3>
                <p>A: User rankings and stats are generated based on username and the database has no way of knowing
                    that 2
                    different accounts are the same person. If you want, you can choose which username you want to keep,
                    then we
                    will merge the stats and delete the other account from the database. Message <a
                        href="https://sh.itjust.works/u/the_real_monte">&#64;the_real_monte</a> with both usernames and
                    which
                    one you want to keep. We will send both a message to both accounts to verifiy you own both. If the
                    instance
                    has shut down, verification will not be necessary as long as the usernames match.</p>

                <h3>Q: "How did you get the data for the stats?"</h3>
                <p>A: The databse log gets posted on Lemmy after the event has ended. We use sqlite and python to
                    generate the
                    statistics. The stats are stored in csv files on Github. The website runs on Angular and is hosted
                    on GitHub
                    Pages.</p>
